# 🌟 STEMx: Skill Exchange Platform for Engineering & Tech

Our website STEMx allows students to search for engineering tools, resources, and softwares, and connect with an experineced professional or academic.
They are then able to message them to ask questions and arrange a day to meet, where the experienced party will teach the student how to use the tool
for their project. After the student is trained on how to use the tool, they can get that skill tag added to their profile by the experienced party. 
We also wanted to inlcude a discussion section for troubleshooting and events section for exploring oportunities for networking and learning events.
